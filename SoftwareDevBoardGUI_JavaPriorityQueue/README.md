# Software Development Request Board

## Objective
The objective is to develop a software development request board form GUI for that allows employees to register requests classified as "Bug", "Technical Issue", "Feature Request", "Sales Question", "Cancellation" or "How To" for the project owner. The system then assigns a priority to the request, based on the request type and processes the requests step by step. The board uses the functionality of the abstract data type Priority Queue in an ArrayList, developed in Java.

## Functionalities:
-Register software development requests (requester, category, description) and add to the queue

-Finish request

-Show next request based on assigned priority

-List all requests

-Output all requests in the queue

-Information field for information output

## Graphical User Interface
